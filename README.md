# Hare-Tortoise_Race_Simulation
This program simulates a race between a hare and a tortoise. 

Movement:
1) This program generates random numbers in order to determine how far forward or backwards either of the animals move.

2) Each animal has different set of possible moves it can make depending on the number generated.

3) If both animals land on the same part of the race track (have the same numerical position out of 70),
the tortoise bites the hare and the program will display "OUCH" for the position on the racetrack both animals landed on.

Winning conditions:

1) If an animal eventually reaches 70, it wins the race.

2) If both animals win on the same "tick" (iteration of loop), the race is declared as a tie.


Display:
1) A race track with the position of both contestants (T-tortoise, H-hare) will be displayed every "tick".
